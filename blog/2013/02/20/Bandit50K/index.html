	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Last week end was held the <a href="http://banditultratrailrun.com">2013 Bandit Ultra Run 50K</a> in Simi Valley.
This race went into my radar few days after I finished the <a href="http://gcalmettes.github.io/blog/2012/12/05/TNF50K/">TNFC 50K</a>
while I was looking for a good race to start off 2013.
The Bandit 50K profile shows more elevation compared to the TNFC 50K, and consists of
2 long major climbs with 4 smaller climbs in between.</p>

  <br/>The Bandit 50K profile
  </div></p>

<p>My preparation for the race has not been optimal.
Early January, my back was blocked due to a vertebral displacement (T7).
Hopefully, after I went to a Doctor of Osteopathy, the slightly out-of-place
vertebrae was back into line and I was able to get back into running. The next two weeks,
wanting to make up
for lost time, I pushed myself a bit harder than usual. This may have
weakened my immune system, as I got hit by the flu the first week of February after
I went to Philadelphia to attend a conference.
I still managed to log some (slow-paced) miles
while recovering, which helped me to keep my morale high with the race approaching.</p>

<p>The day before the Bandit 50K, I went to rent a car
(yes I know it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have been in LA for 2 years and to not
have a car yet ;) ), eager to have a good time on the trails the day after.
I woke up early and drove out to Simi Valley. A lot of runners were already there,
and they were all looking very strong.</p>

<p>The race started and I managed to stay at the back of the lead group for the &ldquo;warming loop&rdquo;
in Corriganville
Park. Trey Barnes (the defending champion) and <a href="http://ultrarunnerrn.blogspot.com">Chris Price</a> (the race record holder)
were setting the pace. I was not feeling very strong, but I was not feeling very weak either.</p>

<p>We reached the first climb and after we passed the tunnel under the 118,
<a href="http://ultrarunnerrn.blogspot.com">Chris Price</a> and <a href="http://jameswalshracing.com">James Walsh</a> started to pull ahead,
with Kenneth Ringled trying to
stay in contact with them. Halfway to the top I was surprised to find myself in 4th place
and I wondered if I wasn&rsquo;t going too fast considering what we will have to run for the
rest of the race. I hold back a little bit and I rapidly got passed by Keith Yanov and
then Chris Zurbuch who both looked very easy in the uphill.</p>

<p>At the top of the climb I was a couple of hundreds feet behind Chris Z and Keith,
but the 3 leaders were already out of sight. We attacked the descent and hit the first major
aid station (Hawaiian theme!), but I didn&rsquo;t stop by as I had still plenty of water
and 3 gels in my pocket.
Right after the aid station we entered the Chumash trail, a long, snaking single-track
descent, with great scenic views over the Simi Valley mountains.
I loved every second of it and I had a lot of fun running it.</p>

<p>Approaching the end of the descent, I got passed by Matthew Ardine.
He was really fast in the downhill
but seemed to be less comfortable in the uphill as we constantly traded spots
back and forth for the next few miles,
me passing him on the climbs and him passing me in the descents.</p>

<p>We ran into the next aid station which was in a residential neighborhood and I re-filled up
my one handheld with water. The volunteers asked me how I was feeling, and I told
them I was feeling good and I was having a great time.
Right after the aid station however, I missed the right turn at the bottom of the &ldquo;Hot-Dog hill&rdquo;
(well maybe I was not feeling
so good finally, lol), but hopefully I was called back almost instantly by the volunteers
who prevented me to be off course for more than just a couple hundreds feet (thank you guys!!).</p>

  <br/>The &ldquo;Hot Dog Hill&rdquo;<br>and the right turn entrance I almost missed</div></p>

<p>After some more hills during which I took care of my nutrition/hydration,
I approached the 15 mile half-course turnaround and I cheered
<a href="http://ultrarunnerrn.blogspot.com">Chris Price</a> who was already coming
back at me. He had a small 1-2 min lead on <a href="http://jameswalshracing.com">James Walsh</a>
and they both were looking very strong.
Chris Z was now in third place as he had passed both Keith and Kenneth.
Kenneth was actually still at the turnaround aid station when I arrived, 2:03 into the race.
I quickly re-filled my one handled, ate my last gel and thanked the volunteers
before heading back into the trail. I ran into <a href="http://j-tris.blogspot.com">Josh Spector</a>,
Trey Barnes and Margaret (leading woman),
on their way to the turnaround, and I cheered them on as well as all the following
other runners coming back at me.
It was great to see all those runners having a great time on the trail.</p>

<p>In the next uphill, I caught a brief glimpse of Keith,
and I calculated that I was just 3 min behind so I convinced myself to run harder.
My efforts didn&rsquo;t pay off as I still didn&rsquo;t catch him back when I hit the residential
neighborhood aid station (mile 20) for the second time of the day.
I quickly filled up my one handled with
electrolyte, and left the aid station with the idea of
pursuing my effort to close the gap. In my hurry, I completely
forgot to eat anything at the aid station and I didn&rsquo;t have any gels left.</p>

<p>The day was starting to get hot, and I attacked the last 5 miles climb of the day.
It was far from being a steep climb, but I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to run it at the pace I
wanted to, so I settled down into a slow-pace run. I was feeling really weak and my body was
begging for calories. I finally reached the top of the climb, thinking that I will be
able to ate some food while enjoying the killer view
on the surrounding mountains that this spot was offering.
Unfortunately the aid station at the top had water only
(Damnit!) but a volunteer told me that next aid station with food was just a
couple miles ahead. It was in fact the Hawaiian aid station I passed by at the
beginning of the day. Once there, I drank a lot of coke, ate two potatoes and some
salty pretzel, hoping to recover some of my energy.</p>

<p>I felt a little better, I thanked the awesome Hawaiian volunteers and started the
last descent back to Corriganville Park.
The descent was very rocky and technical, and I got passed by
Mike McMonagle in this section, just 1.5 mile to the finish, and I was seeing Matthew
also gaining on me.
Once at the bottom, I felt I had my energy back and I bombed on the last flat half
mile to finish in 6th place in 4:40 (2nd in Age Group), 30 min behind Chris Price
who set an amazing new course record.</p>

  <br/>Congratulations to Chris Price for his amazing race and CR!

<p>After the finish, it was nice to introduced myself to and talked to all the local trail guys
(<a href="http://ultrarunnerrn.blogspot.com">Chris</a>, <a href="http://jameswalshracing.com">James</a>, Trey, <a href="http://www.larunner.com">Billy</a>, <a href="http://j-tris.blogspot.com">Josh</a>), they all are
amazing individuals.</p>

<p>I stayed a bit to cheer on the runners finishing their race and then thanked everyone
before leaving as I needed to return the rental car and go back
finishing some work at the lab.
This was really a really great Sunday! Organizers have put on a great event,
and for sure I will be back next year !</p>

<p>Some note learned during the race:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>messing up with nutrition in the second half of the race is not what you want to do</p></li>
<li><p>I need to integrate specific hill training sessions in my training and work on my downhill technique</p></li>
</ul>


<p>My next race is the <a href="http://www.lamarathon.com/">LA Marathon</a>.
This will force me to do more speed workouts, and to run at higher paces.
Hopefully this will be beneficial for
my future trail running races.</p>
