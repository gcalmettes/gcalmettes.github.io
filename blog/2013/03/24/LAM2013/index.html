	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>My goal for this 28th edition of the LA Marathon was ambitious (at least for me ;)):
I wanted to run a sub-3h marathon.
I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy as that would imply to shave almost 26min off my marathon PR
(3:25:39, set at the LA marathon 2012), but I guess we also run to overcome challenges
like that no? However I had the feeling that this goal was attainable
after all the training I went through in the past few months to prepare for the
<a href="http://gcalmettes.github.io/blog/2012/12/05/TNF50K/">TNFC 50K</a> and the <a href="http://gcalmettes.github.io/blog/2013/02/20/Bandit50K/">Bandit Ultra Run 50K</a>.
I was aware that I hadn&rsquo;t really done my homeworks of road specific training, having mostly
focused on trail running for the past 6 months,
but I was doing this race for the 2 on the clock
at the finish line, so basically I wanted to have my cake and eat it too.</p>

<p>This marathon was also special in the sense that I had some family visiting from France,
and David (brother in law) had registered to the race in an attempt to run (and hopefully
finish) his first marathon!
Therefore, I was really excited to share with him the LA marathon route which
showcases Los Angeles and the cities beautifully with its
<a href="http://www.lamarathon.com/event/course-map/">“Stadium to the Sea”</a> route.
The race is a lot of fun and a great way to visit Los Angeles,
beginning at Dodger Stadium and running through famous
cities and landmarks like Chinatown, Hollywood Blvd, the Sunset Strip and Rodeo Drive,
before ending at the Beach near the famous Santa Monica Pier.</p>

<p>On the day before the race, we went to the race expo to pick up our bibs.
I loved the atmosphere there, it was electric and we could really feel the excitement
people at the expo had for the race. We stopped by most of the sponsor booths and grabbed
a ton of goodies ;)</p>

<p><strong>The plan</strong></p>

<p>If you search on the internet, you will find that there are a lot of recommended strategies
to run a sub-3h marathon. Some call for a first slow five miles, followed by
running on pace until mile 20, then a fast close.
Others prefer negative splits where the first half is just slightly slower than the second
half. Some describe just even splits.
The problem was that even if I was in one of the better running shape of my life,
from my previous experience with the marathon distance it was
hard for me to imagine a finish as strong (even splits) or even stronger (negative splits)
than the first part of the race. So in the end my plan was just to run the first half in
more or less 1:28:XX so I would have roughly 4min to spare in the second half. I though it was
also a good idea since
the second half has more downhills, so in the case I cannot sustain the pace
the downhills would help to limit any time damage.</p>

<p>The LA marathon was just 4 weeks after the <a href="http://gcalmettes.github.io/blog/2013/02/20/Bandit50K/">Bandit 50K</a>.
In between, I focused on doing some race specific trainings on road, such as
<a href="http://app.strava.com/activities/42341358">intervals trainings</a> during the week
and long tempo-ish runs on the week-ends (<a href="http://app.strava.com/activities/42181890">#1</a> and <a href="http://app.strava.com/activities/42867616">#2</a>).
I then did for the first time a proper taper on the two last weeks leading to
the race.</p>

<p><strong>The story</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t sleep well the night before the marathon, probably a
mix of pressure and excitement.
After a quick breakfast, David and I headed out to Santa Monica to take the 5:30AM shuttle
and we arrived at the Dodgers stadium with more than one hour
to spare.</p>

<p>There was a lot of runners already there, and the conditions looked perfect.</p>

<p>40min before the start, I made my way to the corral B (previous sub-4h marathon finisher).
Last year, I showed up too late and
the corral access was already closed, so at least this year I didn&rsquo;t do the same mistake.
While waiting for the start, I chatted with some legacy runners, those guys are
amazing and clearly know how to share their passion for the
LA marathon. After some nice chats with my new friends, the gun went off,
and suddenly we were running!</p>

<p>I started a bit faster than the planned pace,
but I wasn&rsquo;t too much worried about it as the first 3 miles of the race are basically all
downhill and I wanted to bank some time before the first hills anyways.</p>

<pre><code>Mile 1 - 6:32
Mile 2 - 6:34
Mile 3 - 6:46
</code></pre>

<p>In the next section we hit a good amount of hills.
I ran them at a very conservative pace to limit my energy expenditure.
Even if it was kind of early for a Sunday morning, there was a lot of spectators cheering
on the runners, especially on this section, and that was clearly a mental boost for me!
By mile 6, I was right on pace and the major hills of the day were already behind me.
I crossed the 10km mark in 42:24, a bit behind schedule but feeling really good.</p>

<pre><code>Mile 4 - 6:51
Mile 5 - 7:03
Mile 6 - 6:52
</code></pre>

<p>Miles 7-14 were basically all flat.
Nothing much happened here, except that I had to quickly stop to empty my bladder
right before entering Hollywood. I was running very relaxed, and my legs were responsive.
I hit the &frac12; marathon mark around 1:29:XX. This was a bit slower than what I
originally planned, but I was more than happy with it and I was
still confident about my sub-3h goal.</p>

<pre><code>Mile 7 - 6:36
Mile 8 - 6:44
Mile 9 - 6:48
Mile 10 - 6:43
Mile 11 - 6:38
Mile 12 - 6:40
Mile 13 - 6:47
Mile 14 - 6:45
</code></pre>

<p>We then ran through West Hollywood, followed by Beverly Hills.
At mile 17 we entered the famous Rodeo Drive where a huge crowd was supporting
the runners, spectators are amazing!
At that point, I noticed that I was passing runners just by keeping my pace.
I was still feeling really good, and those 3 miles flew by.</p>

<pre><code>Mile 15 - 6:26
Mile 16 - 6:38
Mile 17 - 6:53
</code></pre>

<p>We turned back on Santa Monica Blvd just to be cheered on by a huge assembly of
cheerleaders from various LA schools (the so called &ldquo;Cheer Alley&rdquo; landmark).
That was surrealistic,
they were screaming like crazy and I tried to pick up some of their energy to
run this long slightly uphill section of Santa Monica Blvd. At mile 20 we made
a right turn on Sepulveda Blvd, and started our way to enter the VA.</p>

<pre><code>Mile 18 - 6:44
Mile 19 - 6:36
Mile 20 - 6:40
</code></pre>

<p>At the VA entrance the <a href="http://www.clifbar.com">Cliff</a> booth was waiting for us, giving gels
to runners.
I took down two more gels and my energy level went up.
I looked at my watch, happily surprised by the time I was reading on it.
I was on a good track to achieve my sub-3h goal, and mentally at this point of the race
this was a huge boost. In addition, the route from the VA grounds to the finish
is pretty much my home/work neighborhood and I knew I was going to see a lot
of family and friends there, so I was more than ever eager to push myself and
pick up the pace for the
remaining miles.</p>

<pre><code>Mile 21 - 6:49
Mile 22 - 6:42
</code></pre>

<p>Passing the Brentwood Golf, I got cheered on by Pauline and my mother.
It was great to see them.</p>

<p>My buddy Christophe was hanging out a little farther, and he ran with me for almost
half a mile. He took a bunch of pictures, including this one showing my
underwear-based marathon suit.</p>

<p>  <div style="width:image width px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/lam2013-mile23.jpg" alt="LA marathon guillaume calmettes"
  width=50%"width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" />
  <br/>Smiling and feeling really good with only 3 miles to go!
  </div></p>

<p>I also ran into <a href="http://j-tris.blogspot.com">Josh</a> that I had met at the Bandit 50K and who was
pacing some friends toward the finish.
I did my best to give everything I had left on San Vicente Blvd, and I am pretty sure I
experienced the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/health/nutrition/27best.html">runner&rsquo;s high</a> on that section until the finish line,
because I never felt so good while running.</p>

<pre><code>Mile 23 - 6:38
Mile 24 - 6:31
Mile 25 - 6:33
Mile 26 - 6:23
0.35 mi - 5:30
</code></pre>

<p>I crossed the finish line in <strong>2:56:25</strong>, banking a new PR, and good enough
for 104 out of 23,016 finishers.</p>

<p>A huge congratulations to David for having finished his first marathon!
The second half was hard but he stayed focused and did it!</p>

  <br/>Happy marathoners
  </div></p>

<p><strong>The Aftermath</strong></p>

<p>I am super happy to have crushed my sub-3h goal.
This is the first time I finish a marathon feeling really great, and I am sure
this has something to do with my recent focus on trail running which forced me
to double my training volume.
In fact, I didn&rsquo;t realize that during the race, but looking at my official splits
I basically ran negative 10K splits the whole race, something I could imagine I
was able to.
An other interesting point is that my recovery after the marathon was super fast,
probably an other effect of my increase in volume training.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to be back on the trails now!</p>
